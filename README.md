This is an experimental, WIP decompilation of *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* v1.5.0 (Switch).

**This repository does not contain game assets or RomFS content and *cannot* be used to play *Breath of the Wild*.**

The goal of this project is to better understand game internals, aid with glitch hunting and document existing knowledge in a permanent, unambiguous form which helps further reverse engineer the game.
